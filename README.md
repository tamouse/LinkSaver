# LinkServer

Saves links as I browse around the web.

I like to save links as I visit pages, so I can remember them and get
back to them, and sometimes to write a blog post about them.

I'm a heavy Orgmode user in Emacs as well, and have a small
bookmarklet that calls up a server to dump things into emacs using
`org-protocol`.

I've also been using [Pinboard](https://pinboard.io), a paid service
to do basically the same thing.

Plus, I've been meaning to write a significant MEAN stack application,
which I've yet to do.

So here goes!
